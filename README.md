# 🧠 Image Processing with Python & OpenCV

This is a simple mini-project where I explored basic image preprocessing techniques using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Matplotlib**.

The project reads images from a folder, converts them to grayscale, resizes them to a fixed dimension (256x256), and displays side-by-side comparisons of original and processed images. It also saves the preprocessed versions in a separate folder.
